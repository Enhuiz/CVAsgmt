\section{Abstract}
In this assignment, 
we evaluate the performance of the support vector machine based binary classifier
which utilizes features extracted by scale-invariant feature transform and clustered by k-means.
The evaluation is based on the Caltech 101 dataset. 
Results show this method has a great capability on binary classification of images.
