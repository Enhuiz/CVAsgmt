\section{Data Set}

We use the \textbf{Caltech 101} dataset in this assignment. This dataset contain several classes of image. 
Images in this dataset are generally in size of $300 \times 200$ pixels. 
When training one model, 
we use 30 images in the target class as the positive samples and another 30 images picked randomly from other classes as negative samples.
Then we use 10 images different from the training images but still from the target class to test the model.
We use images from five classes to train five models independently.
The five classes are \textbf{anchor}, \textbf{butterfly}, \textbf{chair}, \textbf{cup}, and \textbf{motorbikes}.
Test result will be showed in the next section.
